#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software. I t focuses on creating efficient, reliable scalable and maintainable software solutions using structured methodologies, best practices and programming techniques.
Software engineering enables innovation and technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare, Finance, Education and Entertainment.
Software engineering ensures that software is secure, scalable and efficient reducing bugs and vulnerabilities through structured testing.
Companies rely on software solutions for automation,data analysis and customer engagement which allow them to thrive.
Software engineering supports business expansion without system failures because of well engineered software that can handle growing user demands.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Sotware Engineering (1968)- NATO Conference: Before 1968, software development was unstructures, leading to inefficiencies, high costs and project failures known as the "Software Crisis". In response, NATO organized the first Software Engineering Conference in Germany, coining the term "Software Engineering". This milestone established software engineering as a formal discipline, emphasizing structured development processes, documentation and best practices. It also led to the adoption of systematic software development methodologies.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)- 1980s: Programming shifted from procedural(linear) to object-oriented programming. OOP introduced key concepts; encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, making code more reusable and modular. Languages like C++, Java and Python embraces OOP, improving software design and maintenance. This became the foundation for modern software development, enabling frameworks like Java EE, .NET and mobile app development.
3. The Agile Revolution and DevOps(2001-Present): In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was introduced; emphasizing collaboration, flexibilty and iterative development. Traditional models were slow and rigid, whereas Agile enabled faster, customer-centric development. DevOps later emerged, intergrating delopment and IT operations for continuous deployment and automation. This enabled continuous integration and delivery(CI/CD), crucial for modern software applications and AI-driven systems. It also fueled innovations in SaaS, mobile apps and AI-based software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- This involves defining the project scope, objectives, resources and timeline. Potential risks and feasibility of the project are also identified.
2. Requirements Analysis- It involves gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements. This phase involves stakeholders, business analysts and developers.
3. Design- This phase architects the system structure; defining UI, database models and software architecture.
4. Development(Implementation)- Developers write the actual code based on design specifications; following coding standards and best practices.
5. Testing- This phase ensures the software is ug-free and meets requirements. It includes unit testing, intergration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing(UAT).
6. Deployment- The software is released to production for end-users. It can be rolled out gradually or fully deployed.
7. Maintenance- This phase involves fixing bugs, improving performance and updating features based on feedback. It ensures software remains functional and secure over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall uses a sequential and linear approach while agile uses an iterative and incremental approach.
Waterfall is rigid;changes are difficult to implement while agile is highly flexible; changes are welcome at any stage.
The development phases in waterfall are defined while agile has continuous cycles with ongoing development, testing and feedback.
